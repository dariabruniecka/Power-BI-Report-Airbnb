# Power-BI-Report-Airbnb
This Power BI course project analyzed Airbnb listings in NYC using sample data from Tableau Resources. It featured two views: the main view with interactive charts for ratings, normalized scores, and price comparisons by property type, and the table view for detailed data on beds, prices, reviews, and ratings.
