# Power-BI-Report-Airbnb
This project was completed as part of a Power BI course and involved analyzing Airbnb listings in New York City using publicly available sample data from Tableau Resources. The analysis utilized two main views: the main view and the table view. The main view presented interactive visualizations, such as charts showing average ratings, normalized scores, and price comparisons by property type. The table view provided a detailed analysis of raw data, displaying information such as the number of beds, prices per property, average ratings, and the number of reviews.

The project also implemented filters that allowed users to narrow down results based on various criteria, such as year, borough (e.g., Bronx, Brooklyn, Manhattan), and property type (e.g., apartment, house, boat). These features enabled a tailored analysis to meet specific needs, offering a flexible and dynamic perspective on Airbnb data in New York City.
